Output:
Original list:
[4, 3, 5, 1, 2]
After applying Recursive Insertion Sort the said list becomes:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Original list:
[5, 9, 10, 3, -4, 5, 178, 92, 46, -18, 0, 7]
After applying Recursive Insertion Sort the said list becomes:
[-18, -4, 0, 3, 5, 5, 7, 9, 10, 46, 92, 178]

Original list:
[1.1, 1, 0, -1, -1.1, 0.1]
After applying Recursive Insertion Sort the said list becomes:
[-1.1, -1, 0, 0.1, 1, 1.1]
